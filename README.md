# diskless-linux-exam

Outlines usage of https://www.alpinelinux.org/ as locked-down, net-booted, in-memory OS for exams

## What's this 

Later, once I arrived on Hawaii, I might try to document and implement

- Generation of [PXE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment) netboot images
- Discussion of PXE and security and BIOS and SecureBoot and -- here it stopped 
- Historic: OpenFirmware (Apple), OpenBoot (Origin for Apple: SUN) -- [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)) programming environment
- Today: One BIOS per VENDOR. Zero standards. Security bugs? Unsure. BLOB. Closed Source 
- Google [U-Boot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_U-Boot) ... and [listen U96](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SSau4i_VI8). Remeber [ENIGMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) now, too? Cool, you're on a security curriculum, aren't you?
- UDP, DHCP, DHCPv6 wtf 
- TFTP wtf 
- 16 gigabytes of RAM nice!
- download OS image and SELECTED apps as tgz (gigabit ethernet...) - unpack into memory #tmpfs
- ignore local disk failure or dying disks during exams
- ensure fastest possible environment #EqualOpportunities 
- and or [SafeExamBrowser](https://safeexambrowser.org/news_en.html) to lock down [Moodle](https://moodle.org/), the well-known free, OpenSource LMS, as we know, Learning Management System, which can run quizzes, which can be exams. Yip.

INCOMPLETE. No time. And Assange is still in jail. Free Julian Assange NOW. 
And this might be continued, once I arrive on Hawaii.

# FREE JULIAN ASSANGE NOW = FREE SPEECH

# LEGAL 

Based on the idea initially implemented by 
[Steven Armstrong](https://www.bi.id.ethz.ch/personensuche/personenDetail.view?page=1&lang=de&schnellSuche=armstrong&order=NAME&descending=false&paging=true&pid=228dc) 
of [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/de.html).
For usage of the SIOUX exam tool (Java). If not at D-INFK of ETHZ, you may find
traces at Uni Bern. I tell no more, as Google said no on first try. That's always
a bad sign - if you search some historic GREAT IT tool. And don't find it.
Blame your [Google foo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRiNw490Eq0).
